# HTTP Request Application Specification

Task Objectives
[*] Build an application to retrieve data from an external source
[*] Format parsed data by object scope
[*] Submit application by requesting a repository merge

Sources
[*] Initialize a GET request to the API with valid credentials
[*] Submit a POST request with the retrieved session key

with a formatted display of the objects.
